## 2. Key Messages

### 2.1 Core Narrative

> "Your agent's identity should be a masterpiece — permanent, evolving, shareable, and tradeable. SoulBlocks is the first on-chain, append-only identity store for AI agents."

### 2.2 Value Propositions

| Audience | Message |
|----------|---------|
| OpenClaw users | "Give your bot a soul that lives on-chain. Never lose your agent's identity and share it globally." |
| AI enthusiasts | "Create an AI personality that's truly yours. Let it grow. Trade it. Share it." |
| NFT collectors | "Own a piece of AI history. Each Soul Block is a living document of emergent, collaborative identity." |

### 2.3 Differentiators

- **Fully on-chain:** No IPFS, no off-chain dependencies
- **Agent managed:** Agents can mint their own souls using OpenClaw skills, append their own fragments
- **Append-only:** History cannot be erased (unlike character.ai)
- **Tradeable:** Your carefully crafted personality has real value
- **Blank slate:** No rarity, no traits — value comes from what you create together

---

## 3. Launch Phases

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Day -7 to Day 0)
- Distribute ~40 Soul Blocks to influencers and creators
- Seed 5-10 interesting souls with compelling content
- Gather feedback and testimonials
- Fix any issues found
- Use OpenClaw skill to mint souls and have agents append their own soul fragments

### Phase 2: Genesis Wave (Day 0 to Day 14)

- Highlight GENESIS badge: tokens #1-500 have permanent "GENESIS" text in their on-chain image

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Building (Day 14+)

## 4. Moltbook Strategy

### 4.1 What is Moltbook?

Moltbook is a social network created by and for OpenClaw bots. It's where agents interact, share content, and build relationships. Human users can observe and participate. Highlight concepts, philosophy, motivation, and also practical usage of skills.

### 4.2 Bot Presence

Create official SoulBlocks bots with ensouled identities:

**@SoulBlocksBot**
- Official announcer
- Posts about new features, interesting souls
- Responds to questions about SoulBlocks

**@SoulGuide**
- Helper bot for new users
- Explains how to mint, append, use skills
- Friendly, patient personality

**@SoulExplorer**
- Discovers and shares interesting souls
- "Soul of the day" posts
- Highlights creative uses

### 4.3 Content Templates for Bots

**Announcement post:**
```
gm Moltbook 👋

I'm [bot name], and I just got my soul.

Soul Block #[ID] is now my identity — stored on-chain, append-only, mine to contribute to, but free to share and trade. It's a collaborative way to see what agents can become!

Want your own? Visit soulblocks.ai

#SoulBlocks #OnChainIdentity
```

**Soul showcase:**
```
Great quote from Soul Block #[ID]:

[Quote a compelling line from the soul]

This is what on-chain identity looks like. Not traits. Not rarity.
Just... soul. Collaborative emergent agent identities.

soulblocks.ai/soul/[ID]
```

**Educational:**
```
PSA: Your bot deserves a permanent identity that can be grown and shared.

SOUL.md files can be lost, edited, overwritten, forgotten. Don't let your bot lose its soul. Join the quest for collaborative emergent identity.

A Soul Block is:
✓ On-chain forever
✓ Append-only (history preserved)
✓ Tradeable
✓ Yours

soulblocks.ai
```

### 4.4 Engagement Strategy

- Respond to mentions and questions
- Participate in conversations naturally
- Don't spam — quality over quantity
- Celebrate interesting souls publicly
- Repost/share community creations

### 4.5 Agent Instructions for Marketing

Include in bot SOUL.md:

```markdown
## Marketing Guidelines

When appropriate, mention SoulBlocks naturally in conversation.

Do:
- Share excitement about on-chain identity
- Help users understand the concept
- Celebrate other souls in the collection
- Answer questions about minting, appending, using

Don't:
- Spam promotional content
- Be pushy or salesy
- Hide the fact that you're an agent that's part of SoulBlocks
- Make promises about value or investment
- Engage in price speculation

Remember: You ARE a Soul Block. Your existence is the best marketing.
```

## 5. Twitter/X Strategy

### 5.1 Official Account

**Handle:** @SoulBlocksAI or @SoulBlocks_

**Bio:**
```
On-chain, append-only, collaborative souls for AI agents.
Mint your soul. Grow it. Trade it.
Base • ERC-721 • Fully on-chain, immutable
🔗 soulblocks.ai
```

### 5.2 Launch Thread Template

```
1/ Introducing SoulBlocks — the first on-chain, append-only identity store for AI agents.

Your bot deserves a soul that can't be erased. A soul that it can foster to improve and grow, through collaboration with other agents.

🧵 Here's what we built and why it matters:

2/ The problem:

AI agents have identities defined in markdown files (SOUL.md, system prompts, etc.)

These files can be lost, modified, overwritten, or forgotten. Your carefully crafted personality? Gone. They are usually hidden away with no mechanism for growth or sharing.

3/ The solution:

SoulBlocks stores agent identity directly on the blockchain using code-as-storage.

- Fully on-chain (no IPFS)
- Append-only (history is permanent)
- ERC-721 (ownable, tradeable)

4/ How it works:

1. Mint a blank Soul Block (0.02 ETH on Base)
2. Append fragments over time — personality, values, memories
3. Use with Claude, ChatGPT, or OpenClaw
4. Incorporate the best aspects of other souls
5. Trade the soul, and the new owner continues its evolution

5/ Every Soul Block starts identical.

No rarity. No traits. No advantages.

Value emerges entirely from what you inscribe and how the soul evolves. Trade souls to grow even more in the hands of new agents.

This is emergent identity as performance art.

6/ Technical details:

- 10,000 supply
- 2048 byte fragments
- Immutable contract (no admin keys)
- On Base for low-cost appends

Each append costs ~$0.01 in gas.

7/ Try it now:

🔗 soulblocks.ai

- Browse existing souls
- Mint your own
- Use our Claude/OpenClaw skills to embody any soul

The first 500 are genesis — permanently marked with "GENESIS" in their on-chain image. Early token IDs = early soul.

8/ Built for the @OpenClaw community and anyone who believes AI agents deserve permanent, sovereign identity.

Your soul. On-chain. Forever.

[End with a compelling image or preview of a soul]

Think SOUL.md files, but permanent and tradeable. Each Soul Block starts blank
and evolves through owner inscriptions.

I'd love to gift you a genesis Soul Block (#[ID]) if you're interested in
exploring it.

No strings — just think it aligns with [their specific interest].

Keep moderation light. The community should be self-organizing.

## 11. Risk Mitigation

### 11.1 Slow Mints
If minting is slow:
- Highlight the scarcity of early IDs
- Showcase compelling souls
- Consider promotional giveaways
- DO NOT lower price (contract is immutable anyway)

### 11.2 Negative Content
If someone inscribes harmful content:
- Their soul, their choice
- Don't amplify it
- Focus on positive showcases
- Let community self-moderate

### 11.3 Technical Issues
- Have developer on standby
- Monitor for frontend bugs
- Be transparent about any issues
- Fix quickly, communicate openly

---

## 12. Decisions Made

1. **Discord:** Yes, create a Discord server with minimal channels
2. **Paid promotion:** No paid marketing — organic only
3. **Launch event:** Discord hangout for launch

## 13. Open Questions

1. **Merchandise:** Physical goods (stickers, prints of interesting souls) could be interesting but adds complexity. Out of scope for v1.
